# An implementation of merge sort from bottom-up

## What?
An implementation of merge sort from bottom-up iteratively, using C++. Aiming to reduce the overhead of recursive call and divide stage of top-down approach.
Time: O(nlogn), space: O(n) because there is additional vector created when merging.

## When?
May, 2022. In my freetime solving Leetcode, met a problem which need sorting array.  

## Where?
My house, in front of my computer.  

## Why?
To practice algorithm, C++ programming.  
Curious about bottom-up approach of merge sort.  

## How?
C++ programming, using standard STL library.
